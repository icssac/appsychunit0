Sensation,receive and represent external stimuli
Transduction,sensory info into neural impulses
Absolute threshold,minimum amount of stimulus for 50% detection
Priming effect,association activation
Just-noticeable-difference,minimum difference in stimuli that allows to detect change
Sensory adaptation,continuous stimulation = less sensitivity
Weber's law,"for difference, differ by constant proportion (size) not amount"
Sensory interaction,senses influencing each other
Synesthesia,condition;1 sense is activated by another
Retina,convert light to electrical impulses
Blind spot,area of no photoreceptors
Optic nerve,transmit visual info to brain
Lens,bends light to retina
Fovea,responsible for sharp vision
Cones,detects colour
Rods,detects in darkness
Accomodation,"eye lens change shape, focus to distance"
Nearsightedness,trouble seeing objects from afar
Farsightedness,trouble seeing objects nearby
Light adaptation,dim to bright light adjustment
Dark adaptation,bright to dim light adjustment
Amplitude,height of wave
Wavelength,length of wave
Pitch,measure of frequency
Trichromatic theory,"3 receptors for colour - red, green,blue"
Opponent-process theory,colour has two opposing colours
Ganglion cells,relay information retina to brain
Afterimages,perceiving image away from stimulus
Colour deficiency,colour blindness
Dichromatism,only two cone cells function
Monochromatism,only one cone cells function
Prosopagnosia,unable to recognize face
Blindsight,blind individuals respond to visual stimuli unconsciously
Frequency theory,nerve impulse rate determine frequency
Volley principle,receptor cells combine to process ultra-high-frequency sounds
Place theory,different parts of basilar membrane for different frequencies
Localization,monoaural & binaural
Conduction deafness,damage in middle/outer ear
Sensorineural deafness,damge nerves in inner ear (hair cells)
Sweet,flavours of;sugar and honey
Sour,acidic flavour;lemons and vinegar
Salty,flavours of salt and saline
Bitter,harsh flavour;black coffee
Umami,savoury flavoury; salts of glutamic acid
Oleogustus,fatty flavour (taste of fat)
Taste receptors,"sensory sells on tongue, detects stimuli"
Supertasters,people with intense tasting abilities
Nontasters,people with mild tasting abilities
Nociception,pain
Gate-control theory,"spinal cord has ""gate"" blocking and allowing pain signals"
Phantom limb sensation,phenomenon of sensation in amputated
Vestibular sense,sense of balance (head position)
Semicircular canals,"rotational movements, balance"
Kinesthesis,senses position and movement of body
