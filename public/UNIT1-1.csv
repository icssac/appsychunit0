Traits,Characteristics of an organism
Spinal Cord,(CNS) Connects peripheral nervous system to the brain
Nervous system,System of nerves that carry signals throughout body
Peripheral Nervous System,Nerves branching from the spinal cord
Autonomic Nervous System,Involuntary (automatic) movements
Somatic Nervous System,Voluntary (concious) movements
Sympathetic Nervous System,Excitatory (arousal)
Parasympathetic Nervous System,Inhibitory (calm)
Central nervous system (CNS),Brain & Spinal Cord
Involuntary,Response without concious thinking (not controlled)
Voluntary,Response with concious thinking (controlled)
Neurons,Units making up the nervous system
Glial Cells,Helper neurons
Reflex Arc,Shows how a reflex works though the nervous system
Motor (efferent) neurons,Sends signals (signals from CNS)
Sensory (afferent) neurons,Receives signals (carry)
Interneurons,Connect sensory & motor neurons
Synapse,Gap between neurons (axon terminals & dendrites)
All-or-Nothing Principle,Nerves will fire at the same intensity regardless of the starting
Depolarization,Change membrane potential to positive
Refractory Period,Recovery period between action potentials
Resting Potential,State of neuron when not actively transmitting signals
Reuptake,Left-over neurons being taken back in 
Threshold,Minimum amount of stimulus needed to cause a response

Myasthenia Gravis,Losing control of voluntary muscles
Action Potential,Quick changes in membrane potential (electrical impulses)
Neurotransmitter,Chemicals in body transferring signals from one neuron to another
Excitatory,Assist electrical signals
Inhibitory,Prevent electrical signals
Dopamine,"Pleasure, motivation, motor functions"
