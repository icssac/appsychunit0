Heredity (Nature),parent passes genes to offspring
Nurture,environment
Nature vs Nurture,interaction between genes and environment
Genetic predisposition,has certain traits due to genetics
Heritability,"0/0%=only nurture, 1/100%=only nature"
Natural selection,traits for survival favored
Mutation,"change in gene, new traits"
Eugenics,selective mating for desirable traits
Family (Adoption) studies,genetic influence effects on behavior + mental processes
Twin studies,monozygotic twins (100% DNA) vs dizygotic twins (50% DNA)
Central nervous system (CNS),brain + spinal cord
Voluntary,concious thinking (controlled)
Involuntary,unconcious thinking (not-controlled)
Somatic nervous system,voluntary (concious) movements
Autonomic nervous system,involuntary (automatic) movements
Sympathetic nervous system,excitatory (arousal)
Parasympathetic nervous system,inhibitory (calm)
Neurons,information processors (NV)
Gilal cells,helper neurons
Motor (efferent) neurons,send signals (CNS)
Sensory (afferent) neurons,receive signals
Interneurons,connect sensory and motor neurons
Reflex arc,shows NV responding to stimuli
Synapse,synaptic gap-allows for neurotransmitters to travel
Reuptake,excess neurotransmitters reabsorbed
All-or-Nothing process,neuron either fires or not(same intensity)
Resting potential,neuron state at no action
Action potential,quick change in membrane potential
Depolarization,membrane potential to positive
Refractory period,recovery period
Threshold,minimum stimuli for response
Multiple sclerosis,"(CNS damage) loss of sensory, motor movement"
Myasthenia gravis,(lack nerve-muscle communication) loss of voluntary muscle control
Neurotransmitter,"chemical messengers, NV"
Excitatory,promote electrical signals
Inhibitory,prevent electrical signals
Dopamine,"Neurotransmitter: movement, pleasure, motivation"
Serotonin,Neurotransmitter: mood
Norepinephrine,"Neurotransmitter: alertness, arousal"
Glutamate,"Neurotransmitter: major excitatory, memory"
GABA,Neurotransmitter: major inhibitory neurotransmitter
Endorphins,"Neurotransmitter: remove pain, increase pleasure"
Substance P,Neurotransmitter: pain transmission
Acetycholine,"Neurotransmitter: muscle action, memory"
Hormones,"chemical messengers, slow, effects long"
Adrenaline,Hormone: fight-or-flight
Melatonin,Hormone: sleep (circadian rhythm)
Leptin,Hormone: satiation (fullness)
Oxytocin,"Hormone: bonding, affection"
Ghrelin,Hormone: hunger
Psychoactive drugs,chemicals alters perception
Agonist,mimics a neurotransmitter
Antagonist,blocks neurotransmitters
Reuptake inhibitors,delays/stops neurotransmitter reuptake
Stimulants,"increase alertness,stimulates NV; caffeine"
Depressants,"drowsy, decrease awareness and control; alcohol"
Hallucinogens,"increase relaxation, alters perception of reality; marijuana"
Opioids,"(depressant) quick""euphoria"",pain relief; heroin"
Tolerance,adjustment to drug = higher dose
Addiction,physical/psychological depends on drug
Withdrawal,drug intake discontinued = side effects
