Brain stem,connecting spinal cord and brain
Thalamus,"in charge of senses, except smell"
Cerebellum,"""little brain"";implicit memory, emotions, sounds; no effort"
Recticular activating system,controls arousal
Limbic system,"hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus"
Amygdala,"emotions (fear, agression)"
Hypothalamus,"reward/pleasure center, homeostasis"
Hippocampus,explicit memory
Pituitary gland,master endocrine gland
Medulla,"involuntary (heartbeat, breahting)"
Occipital lobe,visual information
Temporal lobe,auditory information
Parietal lobe,sensory information
Frontal lobe,"motor functions, speaking, decision"
Corpus callosum,fibres connecting two hemispheres
Cerebral cortex,outer layer; higher cognitive function
Lateralization,left vs right hemisphere;special functions
Somatosensory cortex,front of parietal lobe; process touch & motor sense
Motor cortex,rear of frontal lobe; process voluntary movements
Prefrontal cortex,front of frontal lobe; control cognitive behaivior
Association areas,higher cognitive functions
Brain plasticity,brain's ability to adapt and change
Split brain studies,study on communication of left and right hemispheres
Broca's area,produce speech
Wernicke's area,interpret speech
Aphasia,damage in language processing
CT/CAT,x-ray to see brain damage
PET,shows location of glucose during task
MRI,"magnetic fields, waves to see structure"
fMRI,shows brain's function via snapshots
EEG,electrical activity in neurons
Lesioning,destruction of brain tissues
Conciousness,awareness of stimluli
Circadian rhythm,biological clock
Jet lag,circadian rhythm disorder;different time zone
NREM sleep,"dreamless sleep;breathing, heartrate slow"
NREM-1/Stage 1 sleep,(Alpha->Theta) hypnogogic sensations
NREM-2/Stage 2 sleep,(Theta) deeply relax;sleep spindles
NREM-3/Stage 3 sleep,(Delta) deep sleep
REM (rapid-eye-movement) sleep,"dreaming, paradoxical sleep, relaxed"
REM rebound,body's way of catching up REM sleep
Activation synthesis theory,dream is body making sense of nerve impulses
Consolidation theory,dream is reactivated memories
Restoration theory,dream is brain organizing resources
Sleep disorder,disruptions in sleep leads to impairment
Insomnia,difficulty staying/falling asleep
Narcolepsy,uncontrollable urges to fall asleep
REM sleep behavior disorder,acting out dreams
Sleep apnea,difficulty breathing in sleeping
Somnambulism,sleepwalking
