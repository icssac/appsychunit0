Naturalistic Observation,Researcher observes the sample in its natural environment.
Operational Definition,Specific units of measurement of included procedures in the study.
Replication,"Repetition of a past study, ensuring processes are same as the original, to see if the result is same."
Independent Variable,Variable that is manipulated or changed in the study.
Dependent Variable,Variable thats being measured in the study.
Representative Sample,Accurate collection of individuals that reflects all characteristics of the population.
Convenience Sample,"Easily accessible sample, but limited generalizability."
Random Sampling ,Method of selecting individuals from the population that makes sure each member is represented.
Confounding Variable,Variable-separate from the independent variable-that might produce an effect.
Sampling Bias,Choosing the wrong sample which results in an unrepresentative sample.
